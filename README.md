# gh-lua-strip-comments

A very witty attempt at making a comment stripper for Lua. It actually works!

This is extremely quick & dirty. I don't know if it will work with very large projects.


### Options:

- `path:string` - The path to the directory to strip comments from.
- `include-c-style:bool` - Whether to parse C-style comments as well.
